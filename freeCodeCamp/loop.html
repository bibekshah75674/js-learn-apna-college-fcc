        //for...of loops are really useful when you need to loop over values from an iterable like an array or a string. They are also easy to read and can make your code more concise.

        // A for...in loop is best used when you need to loop over the properties of an object. This loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties and non-numeric properties.
